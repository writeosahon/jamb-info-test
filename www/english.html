<br />
<strong>DETAILED SYLLABUS</strong><br />
PAPER 1: (For candidates in The Gambia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia only)<br />
This is an objective/multiple choice paper comprising eighty questions: forty lexical and forty structural questions. Each question will have four options lettered A to D.<br />
<br />
<strong>A. LEXIS</strong><br />
In addition to items testing knowledge of the vocabulary of everyday usage (i.e home, social relationships, and common core school subjects) questions will be set to test candidates&rsquo; ability in the use of the general vocabulary associated with the following fields of human activity:<br />
I. (a) Building and Building Construction;<br />
(b) Agriculture;<br />
(c) Fishing;<br />
(d) Stock exchange;<br />
(e) Health;<br />
(f) Environment;<br />
(g) Culture, Institutions and Ceremonies;<br />
(h) Law and Order;<br />
(i) Motor Vehicles and Travelling;<br />
(j) Government and Administration;<br />
(k) Sports;<br />
(l) Religion;<br />
(m) Science and Technology;<br />
(n) Animal husbandry;<br />
(o) Advertising;<br />
(p) Human Internal Body system and function.<br />
II. Idioms, i.e. idiomatic expressions and collocations (e.g. &lsquo;hook, line and sinker&rsquo;, &lsquo;every Tom, Dick and Harry&rdquo; etc.) the total meaning of which cannot be arrived at simply by consideration of the dictionary meanings of the words in the structures in which they appear.<br />
III. Structural elements of English e.g. sequence of tenses, matching of pronouns with their antecedents, correct use of prepositions etc.<br />
IV. Figurative Usage<br />
The term &lsquo;general&rsquo; vocabulary refers to those words and usage of words normally associated with the fields of human activity in A1 above which are generally known, used and understood by most educated people who, while not engaged in that field of activity may have occasion to read, speak or write about it. Thus, for example, in the vocabulary of transportation by road, one would expect knowledge of terms such as &lsquo;pedestrian bridge&rsquo; and &lsquo;traffic signs&rsquo; which most educated people understand, but not &lsquo;berm&rsquo; or &lsquo;camber&rsquo; which are specialized.<br />
All items will be phrased in such a way as to test the use and understanding of the required lexis, rather than dictionary definitions and explanations. In practice, the test of lexis will be so designed as to explore, not merely the extent of the candidates&rsquo; vocabulary but more importantly<br />
[Type the company name]<br />
their ability to respond to sense relations in the use of lexical items e.g. synonyms, antonyms and homonyms.<br />
In the test of figurative language, candidates will be expected to recognize when an expression is used figuratively and not only when it is used literally.<br />
<strong>B. STRUCTURE</strong><br />
Structure here includes:<br />
(i) The patterns of changes in word-forms which indicate number, tense, degree, etc;<br />
(ii) The patterns in which different categories of words regularly combine to form groups and these groups in turn combine to form sentences;<br />
(iii) The use of structural words e.g. conjunctions, determiners, prepositions, etc.<br />
<strong>PAPER 1: (For candidates in Ghana only)</strong><br />
This is a multiple choice objective paper comprising eighty questions which will be made up of two parts: Parts A and B. Part A will consist of thirty lexical and twenty structured questions, while Part B will have thirty objective questions on literature.<br />
Each question will have four options lettered A to D.<br />
<strong>A. LEXIS</strong><br />
In addition to items testing knowledge of the vocabulary of everyday usage (i.e. home, social relationships, common core school subjects) questions will be set to test the candidates&rsquo; ability in the use of the general vocabulary associated with the following fields of human activity:<br />

(b) Plumbing;<br />
(c) Fishing;<br />
(d) Finance &ndash; commerce, banking, stock exchange, insurance;<br />
(e) Photography;<br />
(f) Mineral exploration;<br />
(g) Common manufacturing industries;<br />
(h) Printing, publishing, the press and libraries;<br />

(p) Communication;<br />
(q) Military;<br />
[Type the company name]<br />
(r) Journalism and Advertising.<br />
The term &lsquo;general vocabulary&rsquo; refers to those words and usage of words normally associated with the relevant field of human activity in (i) above which are generally known, used and understood by most educated people, who, while not engaged in that field of activity, may have occasion to read, speak or write about it. Thus, for example, in the vocabulary of transportation by sea, one would expect knowledge of terms such as &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; and &ldquo;deck&rdquo;, which most educated people understand but not &ldquo;halyard&rdquo;, &ldquo;dodge&rdquo;, &ldquo;davit&rdquo; or &ldquo;thrust block&rdquo;, which are specialized.<br />
II. Idioms, i.e., idiomatic expressions and collocations (e.g. &ldquo;hook, line and sinker&rdquo;, &ldquo;every Tom, Dick and Harry&rdquo; etc) the total meaning of which cannot be arrived at simply by the consideration of the dictionary meanings of words in the structures in which they appear.<br />
III. Structural elements of English e.g. sequence of tenses, concord and the use<br />
of correct prepositions, matching of pronouns with their antecedents, etc.<br />
IV. Figurative Usage<br />
All items will be phrased in such a way as to test the use and understanding of the required lexis, rather than dictionary definitions and explanations. In practice, the test of lexis will be designed to explore, not merely the extent of the candidates&rsquo; vocabulary but more importantly their ability to respond to sense relations in the use of lexical items e.g. synonyms, antonyms and homonyms.<br />
In the test of figurative language, candidates will be expected to recognize when an expression is used figuratively and not only when it is used.<br />
<strong>B. STRUCTURE</strong><br />
Structure here includes:<br />
(i) The patterns of changes in word-forms which indicate number, tense, degree, etc.<br />
(ii) The patterns in which different categories of words regularly combine to form groups and these groups in turn combine to form sentences;<br />
(iii) The use of structural words e.g. conjunctions, determiners, prepositions, etc.<br />

<strong>III. STRESS</strong><br />
<strong>(a) Word Stress</strong> - Candidates should be able to contrast stressed and unstressed syllables in words which are not otherwise distinguished. In addition, they should be aware of the possibility of shifting stress from one syllable to another in different derivations of the same word with consequent change in vowel quality. For the guidance of candidates, a few examples of changing word stress are given below.<br />
&lsquo;increase (noun) in&rsquo;crease (verb)<br />
&lsquo;import &ldquo; im&rsquo;port &ldquo;<br />
&lsquo;rebel &ldquo; re&rsquo;bel &ldquo;<br />
&lsquo;convict &ldquo; con&rsquo;vict &ldquo;<br />
&lsquo;extract &ldquo; ex&rsquo;tract &ldquo;<br />
&lsquo;record &ldquo; re&rsquo;cord &ldquo;<br />
&lsquo;subject &ldquo; sub&rsquo;ject &ldquo;<br />
[Type the company name]<br />
<strong>(b) Sentence Stress</strong> &ndash; Candidates should be aware that stress in sentences in English tends to occur at regular intervals in time. English is therefore called a stress-timed language. They should also be aware that in most sentences, unless some sort of emphasis is introduced, only nouns, main verbs (not auxiliaries), adjectives and adverbs are stressed. Final pronouns should not be stressed, unless some kind of contrast is intended: relative pronouns should not be stressed, nor should possessive pronouns. Thus, for example, the following sentences should be stressed as indicated:<br />
He &lsquo;went to the town and &lsquo;bought some &lsquo;oranges.<br />
I &lsquo;told him to &lsquo;go to the &lsquo;station to &lsquo;ask when the train would &lsquo;leave.<br />
Did you &lsquo;ask him?<br />
I &lsquo;read it but I did not understand it.<br />
They ar&rsquo;rived yesterday.<br />
I &lsquo;fetched his &lsquo;book.<br />
NOTE: There are a few words in English that are pronounced differently depending on whether or not they are stressed in the sentence. These are usually called strong and weak forms.<br />
(c) Emphatic stress &ndash; Candidates should be aware of the use of emphatic stress, most commonly to indicate a contrast, which is realized partly as a change in pitch within the intonational pattern. This falling pitch illustrated below is one of the common ways of indicating this:<br />
He borrowed &lsquo;my newspaper. (i.e. not hers)<br />
He&rsquo; borrowed my newspaper. (i.e. he did not steal it)<br />
He borrowed my &lsquo;newspaper.(i.e. not my book)<br />
&lsquo;He borrowed my newspaper.(i.e. not someone else&rsquo;s)<br />
<strong>IV. INTONATION</strong><br />
Candidates should be made aware of the different forms that English intonation takes in relation to the grammar of the language and the attitudes conveyed by the speaker. There are two basic intonation patterns or tunes: the falling and rising patterns. They should also realize that whereas the normal place for the changing pitch in an intonation is the last stressed syllable of the utterance(as indicated below), placing the changing pitch elsewhere implies a contrast to the item on which this changing pitch falls. For example:<br />
<strong>(a) Falling Pattern</strong><br />
They ar&rsquo;rived to&rsquo;day. - Statement<br />
&lsquo;Where did he &lsquo;go? - WH question<br />
&lsquo;Come &lsquo;here! - Command<br />
<strong>(b) Rising Pattern</strong><br />
[Type the company name]<br />
Did he &lsquo;see the &lsquo;principal? - Yes/No question<br />
When the &lsquo;train arrived. - Incomplete<br />
They arrived to&rsquo;day? - Question<br />
Note that (i) the two patterns indicated above may be combined in longer sentences, e.g.<br />
When the &lsquo;train ar&rsquo;rived, the passengers were on the platform. ( )<br />
(ii) candidates should note, in addition, that any unstressed syllable following the last stressed syllable of the sentence is said on a low level pitch when the pattern is falling, but continues the rise if the pattern is rising. The same rule applies to tags following quoted speech.<br />
Test Of Orals (For candidates in Nigeria and Liberia)<br />
The test will also be of the multiple-choice objective type consisting of sixty questions on a wide range of areas or aspects of Orals as contained in the syllabus.<br />
<strong>The test will cover the following areas:</strong><br />
1. Vowels &ndash; pure vowels and diphthongs;<br />
2. Consonants and clusters;<br />
3. Rhymes;<br />
4. Word stress/Syllable Structure;<br />
5. Emphatic Stress/Intonation Patterns;<br />
6. Phonetic Symbols.</p></div>
